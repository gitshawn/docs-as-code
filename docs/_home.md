# Docs-as-Code

## What?
- Docs live in your repo, in a subfolder `/docs`
- Sourced from markdown and rendered client-side
(even graphs and other elements of your docs!)

## Why?
- Changes go through your current git workflow so they are:
  - Versioned (alongside your codebase)
  - Trackable and approvable
  - Can be rolled back
- Rendered from markdown, so changes are clear
- Rendered client-side, so 
  - There's no build process / pipeline to maintain
  - Changes are immediate upon merge
